"""
Helpers for serving the React SPA (frontend/dist) from the Flask app.

The SPA is served automatically as soon as `frontend/dist/index.html`
exists (i.e. after `cd frontend && npm run build`). Until then — or if
`FRONTEND_SPA` env var is explicitly '0' — the original Jinja templates
keep being served, so the switchover is incremental and reversible:

    FRONTEND_SPA=1 python run.py   # force SPA mode
    FRONTEND_SPA=0 python run.py   # force legacy Jinja mode

API routes (/api, /email/api, /forensic/api, Socket.IO) are untouched
in both modes — the SPA talks to exactly the same backend surface.
